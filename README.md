# Vanguard A/B Testing

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate whether implementing a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI) with in-context prompts positively influences clients' completion rates of Vanguard's online processes.

## Data Source

Vanguard Data Sets


## Tools and Libraries

- Python: Programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
- Pandas: Library used for data manipulation and analysis with DataFrame structures.
- Matplotlib: Library used for creating plots and visualizations.
- Seaborn: Library used for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- NumPy: Library used for numerical computations and data manipulation with arrays.
- Tableu

## Project Structure

- `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `data`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `slides`: Project presentation.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame and cleaned as needed.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics and visualizations are used to understand the dataset's structure and distributions.
3. Visualization: Various plots and graphs are generated to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
4. Insights and Interpretation: The findings from the analysis are summarized, and conclusions are drawn based on the observed patterns.

## Results and Findings

- Improved completion rate and lower drop rates observed.
- Higher error rates detected, indicating areas for improvement.
- Errors may contribute to drop rates.


## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the new interface showed improvements in certain metrics such as lower drop rates and higher completion rates. However, it also exhibited a higher error rate, indicating that there is room for improvement. Therefore, while the test UI demonstrated promising results, it still requires further refinement to optimize its effectiveness.
